# A* Pathfinding

Sup. I'm just making some pathfinding.

tutoriAla:
- trackpada users / mouse-scroll enjoyers. u can move de camera by scrolling or using two fingers. u can also hold alt to move camera
- hold in an empty space to build obstacles, and hold on the obstacle to delete them.
- u can drag the start tile and end tile
- if u done, u can click start. there is a lag spike but ill add the threading later.

To do:
- polish website
- add some cool progressing stuff for the pathfinding
- adding zoom
